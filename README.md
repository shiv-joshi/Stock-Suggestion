This is a python project to help users find more information on a particular stock as well as provide a suggestion on whether to buy or sell the stock right now. The user can choose from three options "1. Stock Valuation," "2. Stock Info," and "3. Live Stock Data." By choosing option 1, the program will run an algorithm comparing the earnings per share and the price to earnings ratio to determine whether the stock is trading well compared to the sector that it is in or not. Option 2 will allow the user to look into the financial statements for the particular stock where as option 3 will return the live data for the stock including percent change, open, close, e.t.c.
